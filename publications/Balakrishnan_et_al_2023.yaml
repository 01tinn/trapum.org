blurb: "We report the re-discovery of PSR J2140−2311B located in the globular cluster M30 and detected using the MeerKAT telescope. This pulsar has eluded detections for the past 20 years and its orbital parameters have been a mystery until now. PSR J2140−2311B has an orbital period of 6.2 days and is in a highly eccentric orbit (e = 0.879) around either a WD/NS. We also measured wdot from pulsar timing and assuming GR, we present here the total mass of the system. This pulsar is located 1.2(1)' from the cluster center and likely formed as a result of a secondary exchange encounter."

blurb: "We report new radio timing solutions from a three-year observing campaign conducted with the MeerKAT and Murriyang telescopes for nine Small Magellanic Cloud pulsars, increasing the number of characterised rotation-powered extragalactic pulsars by 40 per cent. We find that our two new Pulsar Wind Nebula  pulsars are giant glitchers and may be Vela-like."

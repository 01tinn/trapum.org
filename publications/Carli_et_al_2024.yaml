blurb: " We report the discovery of seven new SMC pulsars, doubling this galaxy’s radio pulsar population and increasing the total extragalactic population by nearly a quarter. Our discoveries reveal the first two radio pulsar-PWN systems in the SMC, with only one such system previously known outside our galaxy."

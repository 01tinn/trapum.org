blurb: "We report the discovery of ten new pulsars in the globular cluster Terzan 5, bringing the total number of pulsars in the cluster to 49. Highlights include PSR J1748-2446ao, which is a candidate double neutron star system with a total mass of 3.17 solar masses, and PSR J1748-2446ap, which has the second highest eccentricity for any recycled pulsar (e=0.905)."

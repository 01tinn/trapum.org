blurb: "As part of our survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud, we have published an upper limit on radio pulsations from X-ray pulsar J0058−7218. This limit is 7 times deeper than previous radio searches. This suggests that the radio emission of PSR J0058−7218 is not beamed towards Earth or that PSR J0058−7218 is similar to a handful of Pulsar Wind Nebulae systems that have a very low radio efficiency, such as PSR B0540−6919, the Large Magellanic Cloud Crab pulsar analogue."

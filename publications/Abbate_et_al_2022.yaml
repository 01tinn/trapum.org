blurb: "We report the discovery of four new pulsars in the globular cluster NGC 6624 with the MeerKAT telescope. One of these (J1823-3022) shows a large offset in its position and dispersion measure when compared to all the other pulsars in NGC 6624, making its association with the cluster uncertain."

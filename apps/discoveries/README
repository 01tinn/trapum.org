This application is intended to display pulsar discoveries from TRAPUM/MGPS

To upload a new discovery a YAML file must be created for the discovery and this must be uploaded into the pulsars/ directory.
The format is outlined below:

--- J0000+0000.yaml ---

pulsar_parameters:
  name: J0000+0000   # Jname to be displayed on the webpage
  aliases: []        # List of aliases
  period: 0.001      # period in milliseconds
  dm: 23.234         # dispersion measure in pc cm^-3
  ra: 00:00:00       # J2000 right ascension  
  dec: 00:00:00      # J2000 declination  
  binary: unknown    # unknown, yes, no
  binary_parameters:
    pb: null         # binary period in days
    ecc: null        # eccentricity
    asini: null      # projected semi-major axis in lt-s
discovery_parameters:
  discovery_date: 2021-10-13
  observation_date: 2021-09-12

  - name: 1FGL blah
    type: Fermi LAT (Gamma-ray)

---------------------

# Rules/notes for upload:
- Only published pulsars should include RA/DEC and binary parameters
- Where parameters are unknown they can be replaced by `null`
- Dates are specified YYYY-MM-DD
- All associated images must be uploaded into the TOP-LEVEL images directory for the webpage (e.g. www.trapum.org/images/...)
- Discovery plots should go into the /images/discoveries/ subdirectory
- Thumbnail images are no longer required

There is support for the inclusion of additional content for each pulsar.
This takes the form of a title, set of image paths and some free form markdown
text for the body. These will be displayed in sequence on the pulsar detail modal
(which is displayed when clicking scatter plot points or table cells).

                <p>
                    Utilising the power of MeerKAT, TRAPUM will discover numerous new pulsars and transient events in order to expand our 	knowledge of the populations of sources which emit at radio wavelengths on timescales ranging from microseconds to seconds. The discovery and continued study of these objects provides a powerful tool to improve our understanding	of physics in extreme environments.

                                    <strong>Targeted pulsar searches of SNRs, PWNe, and unidentified Fermi gamma-ray sources</strong>
                                    <br>Supernova remnants (SNRs), pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and Fermi gamma-ray sources host, arguably, some of the most interesting radio pulsars. The discovery of a radio pulsar coincident with a SNR/PWN/gamma-ray source is crucial for understanding the energy budget of such systems and, vice-versa, multi-wavelength counterparts provide substantially more context for understanding the nature of the radio pulsar itself. Discovering young pulsars associated with SNRs or PWNe is important for understanding the Galactic neutron star formation rate, the nature of the supernova explosion, and the injection of high-energy particles into the interstellar medium. Unidentified Fermi gamma-ray sources provide a treasure map for deep pulsar searches and, for example: the millisecond pulsars (MSPs) found can probe accretion physics (e.g. "transitional" MSPs), provide new precision timers for the International Pulsar Timing Array, as well as identify exotic binaries capable of testing gravity and/or constraining the neutron star equation of state.</p><p>
                                        <strong>Globular Cluster Searches</strong>
                                        <br>Globular clusters (GCs) harbor a very large number of MSPs per unit stellar mass compared with the Galactic plane. This is because the dense stellar environments in the cores (10<sup>4</sup> − 10<sup>3</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> pc<sup>−3</sup>) promote collisions and exchange interactions that create binaries capable of recycling old neutron stars to become MSPs. A total of 146 pulsars have been discovered in globular clusters to date, the majority of them MSPs. Some clusters are spectacularly prolific: Terzan 5 and 47 Tuc host 34 and 25 pulsars respectively. Surveying them with MeerKAT therefore has the potential for rich and rapid reward.</p>

                                            <strong>Extragalactic pulsar and transient searches</strong>

                                            MeerKAT has the sensitivity to reveal new pulsars and fast transients beyond the Milky Way. Studying extragalactic pulsars we can help us understand the relationship between the formation of neutron stars and their environement. Only 29 such extragalactic pulsars are known, and all are located in the Magellanic Clouds. Using MeerKAT we will reach a survey sensitivity beyond anything other survey performed before to study not only the Magellanic Clouds but also other galaxies of the local group and beyond. Detecting pulsars and fast transients outside the local group, and determining how much their signal was dispersed by the intergalactic medium will begin to provide us with the tools needed to probe the structure of the intergalact medium. Moreover, understanding the nearby population of giant pulse emitting, or radio-emitting magnetars, has gained even more importance given that they are proposed models for at least some of the fast radio bursts (FRBs) and this is further highlighted by the recent discovery of a repeating FRB.

                                            <strong>Towards a Galactic census</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            The known pulsar population has increased by nearly 50% sources, since 2010 when TRAPUM was first envisioned.
                                            This increase has been achieved by improving techniques and methods on existing telescopes, and new telescopes like LOFAR.
                                            Still, the task of finding even more pulsars could not be more timely.
                                            With new pulsars, new science is enabled, resulting from the bulk properties of the discovered population, from discovered pulsars being probes of the surrounding medium, or by being
                                            exceptional laboratories for testing theories of gravity. With MeerKAT being many times more sensitive than Parkes, the previous largest dish used for pulsar searches in the South, the search for pulsars in the
                                            Galactic plane - the birth place of pulsars - provides a significant and rare sharp increase in sensitivity for exploring the dynamic radio sky. The hundreds of beams combined with much increased sensitivity mean a significant increase in search capability, making a large-scale survey with MeerKAT not only possible, but in fact mandatory.  With time provided by MPIfR’s “S-Band Project”, TRAPUM will conduct a L-Band survey along parts of the inner Galaxy. This TRAPUM survey will be the most sensitive survey of the inner Galactic plane ever conducted, being the benchmark and testbed for the later SKA surveys.

                                            <strong>Using pulsars to probe gravity, dark matter &amp; stellar populations in the Galactic Centre</strong>
                                            <br>The discovery of a pulsar closely orbiting the super-massive black hole at the centre of our Galaxy, Sgr A*, would not only supersede all previous tests of General Relativity (GR) in\
                                            the strong-field regime, it would also enable the space-time around a rotating black hole to be probed with high precision and in a model independent fashion; for example, allowing tests of the cosmic censorship conjecture and the no hair theorem. Such a "laboratory" for precision tests of GR and black hole physics would be unrivalled by any future astrometric measurements of the S-Stars. Furthermore, mass-segregation
                                            in the central parsec may also lead to the presence of additional gravitational testbeds in the form of stellar-mass pulsar black hole binaries. As part of the MPIfR “S-Band Project”, the Max-Planck receivers will be used to conduct a sensitive survey of the innermost region of the Galaxy in the vicinity of the black hole. The MPIfR will share the results with TRAPUM as input for further studies.

                                            <strong>Fast transients – working with <a href='http://www.meertrap.org/'>MeerTRAP</a> to discovering and understand source populations</strong>
                                            <br>The fast transient landscape has changed dramatically since 2010 with the discovery of the population of FRBs, including the revelation that some repeat,  which are exciting in themselves but also highlighted that the dynamic radio sky is still largely unexplored and with potentially more rich rewards. MeerKAT’s unique combination of wide FoV, high sensitivity, and wide bandwidth will provide supreme sensitivity per unit time and frequency making it a prime instrument to study the transient sky. We will carry out <em>commensal observing for fast transients on all of the TRAPUM observations</em> proposed here: High energy point sources and SNRs, globular clusters and external galaxies. </br>
                                            <br> Although not yet granted observing time we also consider here the exciting possibility of the detectability of Lorimer-burst brightness (30 Jy and >400-σ) FRBs with a <strong>MeerKAT Fly’s Eye experiment</strong> (i.e. single-dish observing). In Fly’s Eye mode, MeerKAT will instantaneously cover 0.8 × 64 = 51.2 deg<sup>2</sup>, and will therefore be able to detect rare, bright transient events. Finally, alongside the sheer increase in the number of FRBs detected the other major development is that FRB 121102 has exhibited repeated bursts seen both at Arecibo and with the GBT (Scholz et al. 2016). These bursts are characterised by a range of flux density and strongly varying spectral indices and a wide range of modulation indices that have so far prevented the detection of any possible underlying periodicity. The repeating nature indicates that they are not from a cataclysmic event and suggest that at least some FRBs are possibly associated with neutron star origins, like magnetars or giant pulses from radio pulsars. Crucial to understanding what this means for the FRB population as a whole is <em>determining if all FRBs repeat</em> or whether there are multiple classes.

                                            <strong>Follow Up Timing (To be proposed for) </strong>
                                            <br>After the initial discovery of a pulsar, we want to extract as much science as possible by follow-up timing. Therefore, it is an absolutely crucial aspect of characterising the new TRAPUM pulsars to get a timing solution. In its most basic form this means getting an accurate position, period and period derivative so that one can compare the pulsar properties with the known pulsar population, and in particular for those sources that are found in our targeted searches we are interested in knowing their characteristic ages and their spin-down energies to compare with the SNRs and high energy emission, for example. We are also interested in determining whether or not the sources are potentially high precision timers and so useful for gravitational wave searches, and/or members of binary systems and so potentially useful for mass determinations or tests of gravity.

                                                The Nearby Galaxies working group has now published its first paper! It can be found in the "Publications" section of this website. Remarkably, the first two observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud already revealed 6 new pulsars! The Small Magellanic Cloud survey is also well under way with 7 pulsar discoveries, doubling the currently known population. In addition, nearby galaxies Sextans A and B have been surveyed and a Fast Radio Burst has been found serendipitously. A survey of NGC 253 is currently being processed. Details of our discoveries can be found on the  <a href="/discoveries/"> DISCOVERIES </a> page.

                                                We are proud to announce that TRAPUM together with its sister project the MPIfR Galactic Plane Survey (MGPS) have surpassed 100 pulsar discovieries. Given the source classes that TRAPUM has targeted, more than 60 of these new pulsars have periods below 30 milliseconds with 37 confirmed to be in binary systems. This represents more than a 10% increase in the total number of millisecond pulsars known. With the majority of the discovieres coming since the start of 2021 we are optimistic that we can continue our fantastic discovery rate into 2022 and beyond. Details of our discoveries can be found on the  <a href="/discoveries/"> DISCOVERIES </a> page.

                                                Towards the end of 2021 the TRAPUM collaboration submitted its first report on operations to SARAO. The report detailed how the addition of instrumentation from TRAPUM has enabled MeerKAT to become a premium pulsar and fast transient discovery machine, with TRAPUM discovering 36 pulsars in 11 globulsar clusters, 3 pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud and 15 pulsars (of which 14 are millisecond pulsars) in Fermi-LAT sources. The collaboration received positive feedback from the review committee with the reviewers noting that "The TRAPUM team has demonstrated, through their hard work in collaboration with SARAO teams, that MeerKAT (and by extension SKA1-MID) can be a prolific pulsar search instrument. This required the development of novel instrumentation, and they are to be commended for their achievements. Their transparency in making discovery details public is also welcome. Given their activities and results so far, it would appear that the team is well poised to make major impacts in pulsar astrophysics."

                                                We have started our observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud with TRAPUM in 2021. We have nearly completed four out of eight pointings in this L-band survey, which uses 769 coherent beams and the core dishes of MeerKAT. The survey is partially targeted to supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae. We have discovered several new extragalactic pulsars in the SMC, which you can read about on the  <a href="/discoveries/"> DISCOVERIES </a> webpage. We are also observing other nearby galaxies with the full array.

We observed about a dozen sources using all the available telescopes and about 250 beams arranged to sample the entire gamma-ray error circle of the sources. This forms the first set of sources in our sample prepared for our initial shallow survey which is using the L-band receiver and will include a two-pass approach.

So far we have discovered 10 new pulsars and you can find a summary of the details of these pulsars at our <a href="/discoveries/"> DISCOVERIES </a> webpage. The TRAPUM surveys will use between 250 and 400 beams to allow for covering the entire cluster and will be able to use all 64 dishes to give greater sensitivity.

                                    <h1>Project Organisation:</h1>
                                    <p>The management of the TRAPUM project will
                                        build upon experience gained from our membership
                                        in other large international collaborations such
                                        as LOFAR, the EPTA and SUPERB. An executive
                                        committee composed of the two PIs (Stappers and
                                        Kramer) and a further five members will be the
                                        decision making body responsible for
                                        organisation, membership, resolution, funding
                                        and planning. These five additional members
                                        correspond to approximately 10% of the total
                                        membership and will be drawn from each of the
                                        science working groups (see below), respecting
                                        diversity in nationality and gender, and will
                                        serve a limited term of no more than two
                                        years. The PIs will have the casting vote if
                                        required. While the science working groups will
                                        have significant overlap in membership and
                                        science topics they will have clear and distinct
                                        goals. In addition there will be two technology
                                        working groups which will work with and across
                                        all the science groups to provide the hardware,
                                        software and practical development necessary to
                                        meet the scientific goals. It is expected that
                                        the technology group members will have strong
                                        overlap with all the scientific groups, with at
                                    least one member from each present.</p>

                                    <h2>The working groups are broken down into the following:</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                       <li><strong>Galactic plane survey:</strong> Planning and executing the Galactic plane and Fermi excess survey. This is the largest single observing project and will require strong coordination of resources to ensure the most ecient observing. It will liase strongly with the targeted surveys group to ensure no overlap of targets.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Targeted surveys:</strong> Planning and executing the surveys of the Galactic centre, globular clusters, exter- nal galaxies and high-energy sources. These surveys are grouped together as they all require similar approaches, but they will be broken down further into specific teams which may not include all members.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Pulsar follow-up:</strong> Extracting maximum information from newly discovered pulsars eciently. Liaise with MeerKAT and worldwide pulsar timing projects for follow up radio timing. Organise observations at high energies, optical and perhaps non-photonic windows.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Transient survey and follow-up:</strong> Detection of transient signals and triggering of multi-wavelength follow- up observations. Have agreements in place with a variety observatories to follow-up transients at short notice. Liase with ThunderKAT for follow up as well.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Commensal observing survey:</strong> This task will involve liaising with
                                        the different working groups to determine what
                                        resources can be used and when and also to
                                        optimise the observing strategies of the
                                    targeted surveys described above to ensure optimal transient detection capabilities. Overlap with the follow up component of the Transients working group.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Beamforming:</strong> Development of scheme for phasing up array and polarisation and flux calibration. Includes experts who have performed similar work with other arrays like WSRT,VLA and LOFAR. Majority of the work will be in the initial phases of roll out of beamforming, but then will have a continuing reduced role to assess problems if/when they arise with calibration and related issues.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Particular focus on searching multiple data streams for periodic and transient signals. Also responsible for the organisation of data types, storage and transfer. Includes experts in machine learning approaches to transient and pulsar candidate identification.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Outreach working group:</strong> This is an important aspect of the proposal which all members will contribute to. It will be led by people with significant experience in professional and public outreach and educators.</li>

                                <p>As part of our survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud, we have published an upper limit on radio pulsations from X-ray pulsar J0058−7218. This limit is 7 times deeper than previous radio searches. This suggests that the radio emission of PSR J0058−7218 is not beamed towards Earth or that PSR J0058−7218 is similar to a handful of Pulsar Wind Nebulae systems that have a very low radio efficiency, such as PSR B0540−6919, the Large Magellanic Cloud Crab pulsar analogue.</p>

This pulsar has eluded detections for the past 20 years and its orbital parameters have been a mystery until now. PSR J2140−2311B has an orbital period of 6.2 days and is in a highly eccentric orbit (e = 0.879) around either a WD/NS. We also measured wdot from pulsar timing and assuming GR, we present here the total mass of the system. This pulsar is located 1.2(1)' from the cluster center and likely formed as a result of a secondary exchange encounter.</p>

The survey is unique by operating in a commensal mode, addressing key science objectives of the survey including the discovery of new pulsars and transients as well as studies of Galactic magnetism, the interstellar medium and star formation rates. We have so far discovered 78 new pulsars including 17 confirmed binary systems of which two are potential double neutron star systems. We have also developed an imaging pipeline sensitive to the order of a few tens of micro-Jansky with a spatial resolution of a few arcseconds. Further science operations with an in-house built S-Band receiver operating between 1.7-3.5 GHz are about to commence.</p>
